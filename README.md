## Running the program

To set up the client, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to `client/`.
2. Run the command `npm ci` to install the client-side dependencies.
3. Once the installation is complete, run `npm run dev` to start the client application.

To set up the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a separate terminal and navigate to `server/`.
2. Run the command `npm ci` to install the server-side dependencies.
3. After the installation, run `npm start` to start the server.

Make sure to run the client and server in separate terminals to ensure both are running simultaneously.
